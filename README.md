# Simple quiz in Typescript 

Learning

- Far more comfortable with Types and importing exporting them across components 
- Using gloabls which i've done in python but hadn't occured to me to use in javascript before
- Using functions in utils rather than straight in the component
- First time dealing with an API in typescript but very smooth sailing
- Used alot of Ternary's, however the code looks messy as a result 
- Used prev - not come across it before (refers to previous state), very simple but handy 
- Came across enum for the first time and think it's great 
- Used dangerouslySetInnerHtml (looks sloppy and wouldn't use again)
- Had an problem with a value coming up as undefined - function didn't have a return statement 
- First time with Styled-Components, it's fine i guess however the actual design of the quiz app so far is fairly horrendous
